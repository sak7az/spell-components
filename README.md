So you created an epic level 10 wizard for your friend's one-shot. Why did you 
do this? That's way to many spells to manage. Unless you have a readily available 
encyclopedic memory of the details of your spells, there are a lot of questions 
between you and your epic wizard moves. What's the range on Fireball? How long does 
Magnificent Mansion last? Do you need to be able to move to cast Acid Arrow, because 
it turns out the beholder just paralyzed you at the top of the round... And, would
you believe it, some of your spells actually cost money to cast!

Well, here's a single page React app to help you deal with one of those pesky
questions! Does that spell take components?
